# **Task Pro project**

Task Pro is an application that will help you organize your work and save your time. Thanks to it, you will not forget to perform important tasks, because the application will remind you about them.
It is very easy to use the application. It is enough to register and log in to the application. You can edit your account at any time by changing your photo, name, email address and password. You can manage several projects at the same time, for this you need to create a board for each project. You can choose a different background for each board. Inside each board you can create columns and in each column you can create many cards with tasks. Cards can be moved between columns, edited and deleted. When you create tasks, you can prioritize them by coloring each task according to its importance and set a due date. When the due date arrives, a bell icon will appear on the card.
The app has a tech support service. If you need help with Task Pro, you can send an email describing your problem.
